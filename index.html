        <h1>What is in the <span class="text3">Universe?</span></h1>

        <p>
          The universe is filled with a vast array of celestial bodies, ranging
          from the smallest particles to the most massive cosmic structures. At
          the core of galaxies, supermassive black holes exert immense
          gravitational forces, while neutron stars and pulsars remain as dense
          remnants of massive stellar explosions. The universe is also home to
          billions of galaxies, each containing countless stars, planets, and
          nebulae—vast clouds of gas and dust where new stars are born. Dark
          matter and dark energy, though invisible, make up most of the
          universe, influencing its expansion and structure. Quasars, extremely
          bright and energetic galactic centers powered by black holes, shine
          across cosmic distances. Cosmic microwave background radiation, a
          remnant of the Big Bang, pervades space as evidence of the universe’s
          origin. Beyond the observable universe, the cosmos may contain
          structures and phenomena yet unknown, shaping the grand and mysterious
          expanse of existence.

        <h2>Black <span class="text4">Hole</span></h2>
        <p>
          Black holes are among the most mysterious cosmic objects, much studied
          but not fully understood. These objects aren’t really holes. They’re
          huge concentrations of matter packed into very tiny spaces. A black
          hole is so dense that gravity just beneath its surface, the event
          horizon, is strong enough that nothing – not even light – can
          escape.<br />
          The event horizon isn’t a surface like Earth’s or even the Sun’s. It’s
          a boundary that contains all the matter that makes up the black
          hole.<br />
          There is much we don’t know about black holes, like what matter looks
          like inside their event horizons. However, there is a lot that
          scientists do know about black holes.

              The universe is everything. It includes all of space, and all the
              matter and energy that space contains. It even includes time
              itself and, of course, it includes you. Where do you think you are
              in this vast universe?

            <h4>Falling into a <span class="text5">Black Hole</span></h4>
            <p>
              Falling into a black hole would look like descending into total
              darkness, with extreme light distortion around the edges. As you
              cross the event horizon—the point of no return—you’d see only
              blackness. The most striking effect would be your body stretching
              into a thin strand due to intense gravity, a process called
              spaghettification.

            <p>
              Using the Event Horizon Telescope, scientists obtained the first image of
              the black hole at the center of the galaxy M87. (There is a
              supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy — the Milky
              Way.)
